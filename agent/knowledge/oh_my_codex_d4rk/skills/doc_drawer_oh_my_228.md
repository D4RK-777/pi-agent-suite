## Stage Interface

Every stage implements the `PipelineStage` interface:

```typescript
interface PipelineStage {
  readonly name: string;
  run(ctx: StageContext): Promise<StageResult>;
  canSkip?(ctx: StageContext): boolean;
}
```

Stages receive a `StageContext` with accumulated artifacts from prior stages and
return a `StageResult` with status, artifacts, and duration.
