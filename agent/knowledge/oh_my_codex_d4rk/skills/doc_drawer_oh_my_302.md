ication steps. In deliberate mode, Critic must reject missing/weak pre-mortem or expanded test plan.
5. **Re-review loop** (max 5 iterations): Any non-`APPROVE` Critic verdict (`ITERATE` or `REJECT`) MUST run the same full closed loop:
   a. Collect Architect + Critic feedback
   b. Revise the plan with Planner
   c. Return to Architect review
   d. Return to Critic evaluation
   e. Repeat this loop until Critic returns `APPROVE` or 5 iterations are reached
   f. If 5 iterations are reached without `APPROVE`, present the best version to the user
