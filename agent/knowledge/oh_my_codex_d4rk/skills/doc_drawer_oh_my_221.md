# OMX Setup

Use this skill when users want to install or refresh oh-my-codex for the **current project plus user-level OMX directories**.

## Command

```bash
omx setup [--force] [--dry-run] [--verbose] [--scope <user|project>]
```

If you only want lightweight `AGENTS.md` scaffolding for an existing repo or subtree, use `omx agents-init [path]` instead of full setup.

Supported setup flags (current implementation):
- `--force`: overwrite/reinstall managed artifacts where applicable
- `--dry-run`: print actions without mutating files
- `--verbose`: print per-file/per-step details
- `--scope`: choose install scope (`user`, `project`)

## What this setup actually does
