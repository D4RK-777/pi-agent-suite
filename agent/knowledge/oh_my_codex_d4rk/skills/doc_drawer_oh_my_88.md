- **Ultrawork**: Stops parallel execution (standalone or linked)
- **Ecomode**: Stops token-efficient parallel execution (standalone or linked to ralph)
- **UltraQA**: Stops QA cycling workflow
- **Swarm**: Stops coordinated agent swarm, releases claimed tasks
- **Ultrapilot**: Stops parallel autopilot workers
- **Pipeline**: Stops sequential agent pipeline
- **Team**: Sends shutdown inbox to all workers, waits for exit, kills tmux session, and clears team state
