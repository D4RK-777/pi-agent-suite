ix | `force: ralph do it` or `! ralph do it` | Explicit user override |

### End-to-End Flow Example

1. User types: `ralph add user authentication`
2. Gate detects: execution keyword (`ralph`) + underspecified prompt (no files, functions, or test spec)
3. Gate redirects to **ralplan** with message explaining the redirect
4. Ralplan consensus runs:
   - **Planner** creates initial plan (which files, what auth method, what tests)
   - **Architect** reviews for soundness
   - **Critic** validates quality and testability
5. On consensus approval, user chooses execution path:
   - **ralph**: sequential execution with verification
   - **team**: parallel coordinated agents
6. Execution begins with a clear, bounded plan
