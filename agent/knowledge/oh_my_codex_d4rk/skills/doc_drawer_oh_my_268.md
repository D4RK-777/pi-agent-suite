on persistence, automatic retry on failure, and mandatory verification before completion.
</Purpose>

<Use_When>
- Task requires guaranteed completion with verification (not just "do your best")
- User says "ralph", "don't stop", "must complete", "finish this", or "keep going until done"
- Work may span multiple iterations and needs persistence across retries
- Task benefits from parallel execution with architect sign-off at the end
</Use_When>

<Do_Not_Use_When>
- User wants a full autonomous pipeline from idea to code -- use `autopilot` instead
- User wants to explore or plan before committing -- use `plan` skill instead
- User wants a quick one-shot fix -- delegate directly to an executor agent
- User wants manual control over completion -- use `ultrawork` directly
</Do_Not_Use_When>
