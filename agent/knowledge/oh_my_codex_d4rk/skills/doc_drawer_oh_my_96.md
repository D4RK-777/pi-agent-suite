### 2. Detect Active Modes

The skill now relies on the session-aware state contract rather than hard-coded file paths:
1. Call `state_list_active` to enumerate `.omx/state/sessions/{sessionId}/…` and discover every active session.
2. For each session id, call `state_get_status` to learn which mode is running (`autopilot`, `ralph`, `ultrawork`, etc.) and whether dependent modes exist.
3. If a `session_id` was supplied to `/cancel`, skip legacy fallback entirely and operate solely within that session path; otherwise, consult legacy files in `.omx/state/*.json` only if the state tools report no active session. Swarm remains a shared SQLite/marker mode outside session scoping.
