Codex with no extra workflow layer, you probably do not need OMX.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Codex CLI installed: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- Codex auth configured
- `tmux` on macOS/Linux if you later want the durable team runtime
- `psmux` on native Windows if you later want Windows team mode

### A good first session

Launch OMX the recommended way:

```bash
omx --madmax --high
```

Then try the canonical workflow:

```text
$deep-interview "clarify the authentication change"
$ralplan "approve the safest implementation path"
$ralph "carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
```
