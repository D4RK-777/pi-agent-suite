- Task benefits from concurrent execution but the user will manage completion themselves
</Use_When>

<Do_Not_Use_When>
- Task requires guaranteed completion with verification -- use `ralph` instead (ralph includes ultrawork)
- Task requires a full autonomous pipeline -- use `autopilot` instead (autopilot includes ralph which includes ultrawork)
- There is only one sequential task with no parallelism opportunity -- delegate directly to an executor agent
- User needs session persistence for resume -- use `ralph` which adds persistence on top of ultrawork
