# Cancel Skill

Intelligent cancellation that detects and cancels the active OMX mode.

**The cancel skill is the standard way to complete and exit any OMX mode.**
When the stop hook detects work is complete, it instructs the LLM to invoke
this skill for proper state cleanup. If cancel fails or is interrupted,
retry with `--force` flag, or wait for the 2-hour staleness timeout as
a last resort.
