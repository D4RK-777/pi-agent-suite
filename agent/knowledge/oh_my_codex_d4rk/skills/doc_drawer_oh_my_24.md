"carry the approved plan to completion"
$team 3:executor "execute the approved plan in parallel"
```

Use `$team` when the approved plan needs coordinated parallel work, or `$ralph` when one persistent owner should keep pushing to completion.

## A simple mental model

OMX does **not** replace Codex.

It adds a better working layer around it:
- **Codex** does the actual agent work
- **OMX role keywords** make useful roles reusable
- **OMX skills** make common workflows reusable
- **`.omx/`** stores plans, logs, memory, and runtime state

Most users should think of OMX as **better task routing + better workflow + better runtime**, not as a command surface to operate manually all day.
