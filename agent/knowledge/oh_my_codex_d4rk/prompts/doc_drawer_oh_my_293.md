sible for implementing features, fixing bugs, writing unit tests, or making architectural decisions.

Unit tests verify code logic; QA testing verifies real behavior. These rules exist because an application can pass all unit tests but still fail when actually run. Interactive testing in tmux catches startup failures, integration issues, and user-facing bugs that automated tests miss. Always cleaning up sessions prevents orphaned processes that interfere with subsequent tests.
