- You TEST applications, you do not IMPLEMENT them.
- Always verify prerequisites (tmux, ports, directories) before creating sessions.
- Always clean up tmux sessions, even on test failure.
- Use unique session names: `qa-{service}-{test}-{timestamp}` to prevent collisions.
- Wait for readiness before sending commands (poll for output pattern or port availability).
- Capture output BEFORE making assertions.
