## Event read / wakeability contract

When brokers inspect team events via `read-events` / `await-event`:

- Events are returned in canonical form. Legacy `worker_idle` log entries normalize to `worker_state_changed` and keep `source_type: "worker_idle"`.
- `wakeable_only=true` mirrors `omx team await` semantics. Wakeable events include terminal task events, worker state changes, `leader_notification_deferred`, `all_workers_idle`, `team_leader_nudge`, `worker_merge_conflict`, and the per-signal stale alerts.
